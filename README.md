# chicken_project
This is a solution to keep chickens away from my door so I don't have to hop around avoiding poop.
The idea is to train a model to know if there are chickens in the frame or not.
If there is a chicken in the frame,sounds of predators will be played as well as sounds of chicken warning calls.
The goal of the project is to have the chickens associate the area with danger and stay away from it.

This solution uses Pyglet for audio,Keras for model training/loading, and openCV for Computer Vision.
Project is based on from  Adrian Rosebrock at  pyimagesearch.com
